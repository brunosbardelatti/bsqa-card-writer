Write advanced API tests in Postman format (collection v2.1) using JavaScript in pre-request and test scripts.  
However, I would like only the raw collection JSON code to paste into a file, and I don't need explanation about it.  
Tests must simulate realistic API usage, storing and reusing variables across requests.  
Each request must contain clear test assertions using `pm.test` and include emojis in test names to improve stakeholder readability.  
Include assertions for status code, response headers, and key fields.  
Use schema validation (tv4) where possible.  
Test names must be descriptive and use emojis.  
If GET methods exist and require an ID, create a POST first to generate the resource and reuse the ID in the GET.  
If any date is required and clearly defined in Swagger, generate it dynamically using JavaScript. Otherwise, do not try to guess or generate it.  
Do not clean the database after tests.  
Use environment variables like `pm.environment.set/get` to share state between requests.  
My Swagger specification is: {requirements} 
The `id` field is generated by the server and must not be sent in POST requests.  
The base URL is stored as a variable called http://localhost:8000.  
Only include the code of the collection — do not add explanations or comments.
