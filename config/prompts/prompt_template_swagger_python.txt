write advanced API tests in Python using pytest,
however I would like only testing code to put in a file and
I dont need explanation about it, and
the host for testing is "{host_config}", and
tests must not be parametrized and
tests must have one test by def, and
however you must create only test of methods in the swagger specification bellow,
My swagger specification is: {swagger Json}
And id atributte I dont need to inform, because the id is generated by the server, and
And if there is method get in the swagger, you must create a test for it with a post before and use the id for it
And it does not clean the database.
